# Work in progress

Leaflet editable polyline.

This is still a work in progress (but I hope a first release is comming soon). 

## Why

Most editable polylines have performance problems on bigger polylines because of too many markers shown on a map.
This one should not (when finished :).

## TODO

 * New point on start/end of polyline
 * Split polyline
 * Remove point
 * Split polyline
 * Multiple polylines and consistent points showed
 * Busy for single polyline and all polylines, check busy when moving/adding points
